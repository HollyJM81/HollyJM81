I'm a career-changer to software and web development, having worked as an award-winning orchestral conductor in the UK, Europe, Canada and NZ for the last 10 years. My current tech stack is based on Javascript/Node.js/React/PostgreSQL. Next on my learning list are C, C++ and C#.

I have a particular interest in the intersection of the arts and digital technology, and the possibilities for heightened creativity in real-world and networked spaces. 

I'm passionate about smart solutions for a cleaner and fairer world, commissioning new works and skewing society towards seeing the arts as something to do rather than something to consume.

I'm a maker, a solutions-strategist, and a champion for kindness.
