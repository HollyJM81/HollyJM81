- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HollyJM81
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of software design, gamification and the arts - particularly designing software and web apps that increase and democratise access to creativity.   
- :mortar_board: Iâ€™ve just started the [CommandShift](https://www.commandshift.co) Bootcamp - March '23 Cohort, and loving being in a learning environment again. Over the last few years I've dabbled in self-guided learning on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). I've also made a few dinky little apps on my own, including my first web app from scratch, which includes 2 asynchronous API requests in response to a single user input. Dead proud. 
- :musical_note: In my everyday life I'm a professional classical musician working in the UK, EU, Canada, and New Zealand, but keen to transition out of performing and into tech. 
- :construction: Iâ€™d love to be brought in to consult or help out with music-centred code projects, but also definitely up for being a junior coder/spare set of hands on someone else's project to further my learning.
- ðŸ“« I'm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hollymathieson/) & [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hollyjmathieson/), and have a blog on all things codeNewbie, art music, inclusion and 
accessibility called [Scordatura](https://www.scordatura.io/). You can read about my conducting life on my [website](https://www.hollymathieson.com/).
