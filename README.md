- 👋 Hi, I’m @HollyJM81
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of software design, gamification and the arts - particularly designing software and web apps that increase and democratise access to creativity.   
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript - just made my first web app from scratch, which includes 2 asynchronous API requests in response to a single user input. Dead proud. 
In my everyday life I'm a professional classical musician working in the UK, Eu, Canada, and New Zealand, but keen to transition out of performing and into tech. 
- 💞️ I’d love to be a brought in to consult or help out with music-centred code projects, but also definitely up for being a junior coder/spare set of hands 
on someone else's project to further my learning.
- 📫 I'm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hollymathieson/) & [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hollyjmathieson/), and have a blog on all things codeNewbie, art music, inclusion, 
accessibility called [Scordatura](https://www.scordatura.io/)
